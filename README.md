## Application 

### Introduction

The project will focus on the Herring Gull data provided by the Lifewatch project. An open data is available at the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) as [published data set](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/83e20573-f7dd-4852-9159-21566e1e691e).

Within the scope of the project, the Herring Gulls are studied on a more extended data set, containing also the accelerometer data and linked behaviour information (annotated by experts).

### Inspiration

Relevant literature will be stored in the `literature` subfolder. Furthermore, following links are worthwhile to have a look:

- Dutch partner institute uva-Bits, developing the GPS trackers and providing some additional tools to access and check the data, http://www.uva-bits.nl/virtual-lab/
- INBO R package with some enrichment functionalities to analyze the bird tracking data,https://github.com/inbo/bird-tracking-etl
- Interactieve voorstelling bird tracking data developed by Lifewatch, http://inbo.github.io/bird-tracking/explorer/index.html check the code [here](https://github.com/inbo/bird-tracking)
- Interactive exploration tool of migration patterns develope on the open data set of the gulls, developed by Maximilian Konzack, http://www.win.tue.nl/~kbuchin/proj/gullmigration/ check the code [here](https://github.com/komax/migration-patterns-gull-data). The paper is in the literature folder. The output was part of a student workshop, see [report](https://komax.github.io/papers/gull_migration_vcma.pdf).
